## Introduction
This repository is about the robot we made for the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2023. Here, we are going to explain in detail how the robot operates and we will also go through the general structure of our code.

## Mechanical parts
The vehicle itself is mostly consisted out of LEGOs, but some parts had to be 3D printed, in order for us to connect the sensors and the motors onto the robot. 
### Sensors
We used:
- 2 distance sensors
- 1 color sensor
- 1 gyroscope
- 2 encoders
- 1 camera
### Motors
We used one motor which moves both back weels of our vehicle with the help of a differential. We also used a servo motor which is responsible for the steering process of our robot.
